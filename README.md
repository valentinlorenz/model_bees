# The Effect of Landscape Structure on Solitary Bees - a NetLogo Agent-based Model

Solitary bee populations have been declining globally, in particular due to landuse change and the intensification of agriculture, damning both native plants and crops depending on pollination. Due to solitary beesâ€™ specific habitat requirements, agricultural fields alone are often unable to sustain them. This is especially true for solitary bees that are specialized to a specific plant and may be unable to utilize the resources of agricultural lands. Land sparing, or the practice of leaving patches of natural habitat for feeding and nesting, has been suggested to be beneficial to bee populations. Especially the size, amount and connectivity of patches may have a large impact on solitary bees.  

Therefore, this model tries to show the effect of landscape structure on solitary bee populations. It can not only be used to investigate the impact of habitat number, size and distance, but also the differences between generalist and specialist bees and the pollination outcome.  

## Using the model

To use the model, follow these steps:
1. Install NetLogo from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml.
2. Clone this repository to your local computer. For instructions see for example https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository  
3. Open bee_model.nlogo by double-clicking on it.
4. Read the Info tab in NetLogo to learn more about the model and how to use it.

Results of simulation experiments we ran are available in experiment_results.csv (raw) and table_results.csv (formatted for analysis in R).
If you want to have a look at them, you can open bee_model_results_analysis.R in R, set your working directory to the folder containing the table_results.csv file and run the R script.
